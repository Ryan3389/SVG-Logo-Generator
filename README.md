# SVG-Logo-Generator

## Description
This is an application that dynamically generates an SVG image by answering a few short questions about the shape, font color and text color. The main technologies used in this app are node.js, inquirer, which is responsible for creating the questions in the terminal, and Jest to conduct a series of tests to ensure functions are rendering correctly.
